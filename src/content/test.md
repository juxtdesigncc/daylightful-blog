# 1/2/2025

Kicking off the new year with a review! This tradition, which I started way back in 2019, marks its fifth year - we're halfway through to a decade of annual reflections!

1. Friends of Figma, Hong Kong had its biggest year yet, with our events bringing together more designers in Hong Kong than ever before. Thanks again to my amazing fellow moderators (Michelle Lock, YS Chung and Joey, Wing Sze Lee), we have organised 4 all in-person events with record-breaking 200+ attendees in total, half of which joined our biggest CONFIG Watch Party at Soho House in June this year. On the side, I have accumulated 500 minutes of mentoring session on adplist.org with people around the world!

2. It's almost surreal to look back the past year, I would describe it as one of the most challenging years in my career: launching a crypto Earn product from scratch, shipping countless visual and functional revamps, inheriting a new squad with limited resources, saying goodbyes and meeting new friends. 

I'm filled with gratitude for the journey, lessons learned, and most importantly, the relationships bonded. While new adventures may come, the growth and memories from this year will always be a cherished part of my journey.

3. 2024 was also a year I started the journey of reflection and mindfulness in the latter part of the year. Starting a journaling practice, has been transformative (with physical pen and paper), especially for someone as digital-savvy as myself. It helped me seek balance in both my personal and professional life, leading to clearer thinking and better decision-making. Iâ€™m looking forward to the day when my notebook is filled, serving as a record of my growth and experiences. Knowing this practice would integrate into my life and shape my perspective forward excites me the most stepping into 2025.

4. This year was all about embracing new challenges. Whether it was perfecting my latte art, advancing in tennis, or volunteering at work and at my wifeâ€™s social enterprise Agewhale. These experiences pushed me to develop new skills and perspectives, engaging my mind and body in ways that a desk job and staying in my comfort zone never could. By placing myself in the position of a learner regularly, I've gained fresh perspectives that enhance my approach to design and life.
